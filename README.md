# Platformer
I have never actually finished a game. I will be making this game over the course of one week, and at the end of the week I hopefully will have a finished game. I will not work on the game anymore after the week.

# Lore
You are an explorer who must traverse through old ancient temples. These temples are full of difficult platforming challenges, enemies, and puzzles.

# Ideas
- Crates that can be broken for supplies
- Different enemies
- Snappy movement system
- At least three different levels (jungle, desert, something else)
- Menu screens
- Swinging on rope
- Climbing ladders
- Fall damage
- Swimming
- Ambient sounds, music
- Controller support
- Different materials with different friction levels
